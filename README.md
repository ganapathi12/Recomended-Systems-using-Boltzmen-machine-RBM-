# Recomended-Systems-using-Boltzmen-machine-RBM-
this recomended system is implimented using restricted boltzmen machine which is a probabalistic graphical model, here i have used the concept of contrastive divergence and gibbs sampling for training my model, the model is trained with 100k movie reviews with 80k as training set and 20k as test set and i have also listed the monte carlo markov chain techniques during implimentation of test set and the loss function is calculated using average distancee which uses simplified distance in absolute value, With this metric, i had obtained an Average Distance of 0.24, which is equivalent to about 75% of correct prediction, the dataset is obtained from grouplens.org in movie datsets.
